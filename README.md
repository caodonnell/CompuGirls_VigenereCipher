A couple Python-3 Jupyter notebooks to create a coding experience for the CompuGirls Hawaii: Cybersecurity program. This relates to the unit on cryptography (specifically, Week 6 in Spring 2021). Students will explore Vigenere ciphers as a hands-on way to learn about encrypting and decrypting data. These notebooks are also meant to tie into the next unit using micro:bit, and so it goes into a bit more detail about how to go about creating code.
