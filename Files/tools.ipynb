The difference with the Vigenère cipher it that the shift is based on a set key, which leads to the following differences in the function definition:\n",
    "1. The key is a _required argument_ (whereas with the Caesar cipher, the shift was optional since a default value could be defined).\n",
    "2. For each letter in the original text, the amount of shift has to be defined based on the next character in the key (`alphabet.index(k)`, in place of `shift` from the Caesar cipher).\n",
    "3. We also have to have a variable to keep track of how many characters we've encrypted so far (`letter_count`). Otherwise, non-letter characters (spaces or punctuation) will cause us to skip over some of the characters in the key.\n",

    "As noted in the presentation, one of the ways we can strengthen our keys is if we use a string of random letters that's as long as our text. Using Python, we can easily generate these types of keys. However, generating random numbers isn't a built-in Python function, so we have to `import` a module, which means we tell Python we want to have access to additional functions and variables. To use the functions within a module, you'll need to reference them with the module name. For example, here we are using the `random` module, which contains a function called `randint()` that produces random integers (i.e., whole numbers like 0, 4, or 124). The function takes arguments for the minimum and maximum integer returned, so `randint(0, 10)` will produce numbers such as 0 or 4 or (at most) 10, but it won't return 124. To run the function, we have to give Python the command `random.randint(0, 10)` since the function belongs to the module. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also use the `range()` function, which produces a list of numbers starting at 0 and ending just before the argument passed to the function. For example, `range(5)` will produce `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. So, if we create `for`-loop with `for i in range(5)`, the code will do the following:\n",
